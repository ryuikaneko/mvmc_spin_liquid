# spin liquids and unconventional ordered states by mVMC

## What do these scripts do?

* Description of spin liquids and unconventional ordered states by fermionic wave functions such as the projected BCS states and the Slater-Jastrow wave functions
* Use [mVMC](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/mVMC) with the generalized pairing wave functions that include the projected BCS states and the Slater-Jastrow wave functions
